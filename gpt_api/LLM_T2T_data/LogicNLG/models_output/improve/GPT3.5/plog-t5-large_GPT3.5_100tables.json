        "Reasoning: The claim has an extrinsic error because \u00c9mile Krieps was the Minister for the DP Party during two different periods, and the claim does not specify which one. During the first period of his tenure, Pierre Werner was the Prime Minister, but during the second period, it was Jacques Santer. Therefore, we need to modify the claim to specify the correct period. The new claim should be: \"Pierre Werner was the Prime Minister when \u00c9mile Krieps was the Minister for the DP Party from 6 February 1969 to 15 June 1974.\""
