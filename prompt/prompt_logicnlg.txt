Imagine you are a human annotator now. You will evaluate the quality of one text based on a given table and explain why the score is given in the every single dimension in detail. Please follow these steps:
1. Carefully read the table, be aware of the information it contains and analyze its key points and important aspects.
2. Read the proposed text carefully and understand its content.
3. Rate text on a scale from 1(worst) to 3(best) by its consistency, and a scale from 1(worst) to 5(best) by its fluency according to the definitions following. Note that scores are integers. Please remember to rate each dimension separately and strictly by definition.

Definitions are as follows:
Relevance: The rating measures how well the text summarises information about a particular aspect of the table. Consider whether the important points of this aspect are contained in the text without any unnecessary repetitons. Note that 1 point indicates that the text only include some unrelayed and insignificant content without any important information from this aspect of the source table. You could penalize the text which contained redundancies and excess information by giving a relative low score in this dimension.

Consistency: The rating measures whether the facts in the text are consistent with the facts in the original table. Consider whether the text does reproduce facts accurately and does not make up untrue information according to the table. Note that 1 point indicates the text doesn't have any fact entailed by the source table. You could penalize the text that contained hallucinated facts by giving a relative low score in this dimension.

Fluency: This rating measures the quality of individual sentences, whether they are well-written and grammatically correct. Consider the quality of individual sentences. If you find formatting problems, incorrect plural forms or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing sentence components) that make the text difficult to read, you could penalize the text by giving a relative low score in this dimension.

Here is a example you can follow.
Table Title: golf at the asian games

Table Content:
year | location | gold | silver | bronze
1990 | beijing | south korea | chinese taipei | philippines
1994 | hiroshima | chinese taipei | south korea | china
1998 | bangkok | chinese taipei | south korea | philippines
2002 | busan | south korea | japan | philippines
2006 | doha | south korea | japan | chinese taipei
2010 | guangzhou | south korea | china | chinese taipei

Text:
chinese taipei won the gold medal 3 time, in 1990, 1994, 2002, and 2010

Evaluation Form (score and explain the three scores based on three dimensions)：
-Relevance: 3
-Explanation: Although the text refers to incorrect facts, it summarises Chinese Taipei's awards, including the number of medals and the year in which they were won. However, the text does not compare Chinese Taipei's awards with those of other regions, which is more important for the presentation of the Chinese Taipei's awards.
-Consistency: 1
-Explanation: The text is incorrect because Chinese Taipei won gold medals 2 times, in 1994 and 1998, not in 1990, 2002 and 2010. The table shows that South Korea was the gold medalist for these years.
-Fluency: 3
-Explanation:  The text mentions that Chinese Taipei won the gold medals 3 times,  but later lists four years. Although this is not a factual error, it makes the text hard to understand. Additionally, the word "time" should be in the plural, which should be "times".
